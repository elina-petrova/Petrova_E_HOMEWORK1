<p> I met Jihee at the fist lesson in Fanshawe college. At first sight I realised that she is destined to by friend. Lately we found out how many thing we have in common. We love the same kind of music, movies, food. She is always ready to help me with studies. Words cant express how I am glad to meet her! </p>

<h2>ELINA</h2>

<p> Hi! My name is Elina Petrova. I came to Canada from Russia as an international student. It was my dream that finally came true! If you ever met me, first thing you would learn about me is how much I love music. I dare say... I'm addicted to it. Can spend hours just listeting and daydreaming. But don't call me lay! My other hobby: styding. I like the feeling when you lear something you have never thought of. And because I like to study - my brains always need power. Eating good food gives me pleasure. Me favourite kind is Itallian. Could kill for a piece of pizza. Hope you are not afraid of meeting me now!
